## Components Overview
1. View
Usage: Acts as a container for other components, providing structure and layout management. View components can be nested, styled, and positioned to create complex layouts and UI elements.
2. Text
Usage: Renders text strings in the app. Text components can be styled for font size, color, weight, alignment, and other text properties, and they can also include nested Text components for inline styling.
3. ScrollView
Usage: Creates a scrollable container that can host multiple child components. Useful for displaying content that exceeds the screen size vertically or horizontally. ScrollView supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling.
4. TextInput
Usage: Provides a field for user input. TextInput components can be customized with placeholders, default values, secure text entry for passwords, and handlers for managing user input and changes.
5. Stylesheet
Usage: Defines a set of styles for the components in the application. Using StyleSheet, you can create and manage styles in a centralized and efficient way, enhancing the readability and maintainability of your code.
6. Pressable
Usage: Adds a pressable element for user interactions. Pressable can be styled and configured with different handlers to perform actions when pressed. They can also be customized with the attribute of onPress.
7. FlatList / SectionList
Usage: Efficiently renders large lists of data. FlatList is used for simple, flat lists, whereas SectionList is used for lists with section headers. Both components support various optimizations like lazy loading, item reuse, and more for performance enhancement.
8. Image
Usage: Displays images and icons in the app. Image components can be sourced from local files or remote URLs and styled to fit the design needs, including resizing, aspect ratio management, and more.
